The topological modular forms spectrum gives an amazing intersection between abstract, conceptual mathematics and actual calculations; it is both interesting enough to need some form of derived algebraic geometry, yet tractable enough that we can actually calculate its homotopy groups. The $tmf$ spectrum gives us information about the homotopy groups of spheres (and so exotic spheres), and so leads to some very important results. These notes are born out of the author's attempt to put together various higher-categorical tools to understand both the $tmf$ spectrum and these higher-categorical tools. We discuss the abstract tools needed to define $tmf$ and the Adams(-Novikov) spectral sequences used to calculate its homotopy groups.
